    <ol>
      <li>Email IDs not logged in for over a month will be <strong>locked</strong>. The account will still receive emails, but login will be disabled. On request, the password will be reset and shared with the user.</li>
      <li>Invalid password entry more than 5 times will lock the account. Reset will be done and communicated on request.</li>
      <li>Users are <strong>responsible for all activities</strong> performed using their Email IDs. Do not share or use others’ credentials. Treat passwords as confidential.</li>
      <li>Change your password <strong>immediately</strong> if it's suspected to be compromised or known by an unauthorized person.</li>
      <li>Temporary passwords must be changed on the first login.</li>
      <li>Password reset is <strong>mandatory every 30 days</strong>. Failing to do so will expire the current password.</li>
      <li>Idle time logout is enabled to prevent cybersecurity threats and misuse.</li>
      <li>Password reset requests must be raised through <strong>designation-based emails</strong> (e.g., Managers, Senior Managers, Superintending Engineers) from the <code>@tnebnet.org</code> domain only.</li>
      <li>The owner of the user ID is fully responsible for the <strong>safety and confidentiality</strong> of credentials. Passwords must not be shared with colleagues, vendors, or clients.</li>
      <li>If an email account is found to be <strong>violated or corrupted</strong>, it will be locked without prior notice and reset on request.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="donts-section">
      <h4 class="text-danger">❌ Don'ts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not reveal your password to anyone. The Email ID owner is solely responsible for its maintenance.</li>
        <li>Do not save your passwords in any format (browser, password manager, printed copy, etc.).</li>
        <li>Avoid setting <strong>weak passwords</strong> such as repeating the username.</li>
        <li>Do not reuse the <strong>last three passwords</strong> when resetting.</li>
        <li>Password reset requests from personal domains (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo) will not be entertained.</li>
        <li>Requests from <code>@tnebltd.org</code> or name-based emails will not be accepted for <strong>designation-based</strong> email IDs.</li>
